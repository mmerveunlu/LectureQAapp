hi everyone welcome to signals and systems course

00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:23.909
in this video I am going to explain discrete time exponential and sinusoidal signals

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:28.307
these signals are the basic building blocks for many other signals

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:34.853
a discrete time complex exponential signal is defined as given here

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:39.028
where capital c and alpha are in general complex numbers

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:42.461
alternatively it is expressed as given below

00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:48.102
if c and alpha are real the signal is called real exponential signal

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:56.278
the real exponential discrete time signal can have one of the behaviors given in the figure depending on the value of alpha

00:00:56.278 --> 00:00:59.133
in a complex exponential signal

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:04.651
if beta is purely imaginary we obtain the signal given in the red box

00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:10.510
as in the continuous time case this signal is closely related with the sinusoidal signal

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:18.411
these signals are the examples of discrete time signals with infinite total energy and finite average power

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:23.672
some example discrete time sinusoidal signals are given in this figure

00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:29.988
if c and alpha are complex numbers here they are represented in polar form

00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:35.151
then we obtain the complex exponential in general form as given in the red box

00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:41.209
we obtain one of the behavior given in the figure depending on the sign of alpha

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:46.215
even though there are similarities between continuous time and discrete time signals

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:49.096
there are also many important differences

00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:54.882
this table shows the comparison of continuous time and discrete time complex exponentials

00:01:54.882 --> 00:02:02.250
the first difference is that distinct values of omega zero results in distinct signals in the time domain

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.053
for instance higher values of omega zero result in higher rate of oscillations in the signal

00:02:09.053 --> 00:02:13.908
however it is not the case in discrete time complex exponentials

00:02:13.908 --> 00:02:22.592
in discrete time the signals are identical for values of omega zero separated by multiples of two pie

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:28.477
second continuous time exponentials are periodic for any choice of omega zero

00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:39.254
however discrete time exponentials are periodic only if omega zero equals two pie times m over n for some integers m and n

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:44.803
third fundamental frequency of omega zero for continuous time exponentials

00:02:44.803 --> 00:02:50.416
whereas it is omega zero divided by m for discrete time exponentials

00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:56.178
the fundamental periods for these signals are given in the below row

00:02:56.178 --> 00:03:01.974
in this video I have explained discrete time exponential and sinusoidal signals

00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:06.000
let me know if you have any questions
