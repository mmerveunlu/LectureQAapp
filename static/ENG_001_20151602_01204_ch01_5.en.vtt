00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:17.377
hi everyone welcome to signals and systems course

00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:23.789
in this video I am going to explain basic properties of continuous time and discrete time systems

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.843
as we have already discussed the systems are also categorized as continuous time and discrete time

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:37.299
a continuous time system transforms a continuous time input signal into a continuous time output signal

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:44.601
a discrete time system transforms a discrete time input signal into a discrete time output signal

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:50.342
many real systems are built as the interconnections of several subsystems

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:55.043
these figures show some frequently used interconnections

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:59.238
figure a shows a series or cascade interconnection

00:00:59.238 --> 00:01:02.432
figure b shows a parallel interconnection

00:01:02.432 --> 00:01:06.256
figure c shows a series parallel interconnection

00:01:06.256 --> 00:01:10.968
and the figure on the right hand side shows a feedback interconnection

00:01:10.968 --> 00:01:14.237
let's move to the basic system properties

00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:17.346
the first property is being memoryless

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:25.013
a system is said to be memoryless if its output at any given time depends only on the input at the same time

00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:27.999
otherwise it is a system with memory

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:37.266
for instance in the given system the output y only depends on the input x at the same time so this system is memoryless

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.501
the second property is invertibility

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:47.034
a system is said to be invertible if distinct inputs lead to distinct outputs

00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:55.803
if a system is invertible then any inverse system exists and if we cascade the inverse system to the original system

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:58.457
we obtain the same input signal

00:01:58.457 --> 00:02:00.699
the figure shows this property

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:03.697
the third property is causality

00:02:03.697 --> 00:02:12.712
a system is causal if the output at any time depends on values of the output at only the present and past times

00:02:12.712 --> 00:02:16.605
for instance the first system given here is causal

00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:21.424
however the second system the output depends on the future input

00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:24.222
therefore it is not a causal system

00:02:24.222 --> 00:02:28.141
note that all memoryless systems are causal

00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:30.993
the fourth property is stability

00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:38.542
a stable system in a stable system small inputs lead to responses that do not diverge

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:42.950
an easy way of analyzing the stability of a system is to check

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.836
if a bounded input results in a bounded output

00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:49.860
if that is the case then the system is stable

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.098
an example stable system is given here

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:59.547
if the input x of t is bounded then the output y of t is also bounded

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:02.180
therefore the system is stable here

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.403
the fifth and one of the most important properties is the time invariance

00:03:07.403 --> 00:03:15.264
informally a system is time invariant if the behavior and characteristics of the system are fixed over time

00:03:15.264 --> 00:03:19.739
more formally we can define a time invariant system as follows

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:27.915
a system is time invariant if a time shift in the input signal results in an identical time shift in the output signal

00:03:27.915 --> 00:03:35.192
assume that we have a system where y of t is the output when x of t is the input

00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:46.188
the system is time invariant if y of t minus t zero is the output when x of t minus t zero is the input

00:03:46.188 --> 00:03:51.241
the last and the other important system property is linearity

00:03:51.241 --> 00:04:03.347
a system is linear if an input consists of the sum of several signals and the output is the superposition of the responses of the system to each of those inputs

00:04:03.347 --> 00:04:09.096
more formally if a system is linear the given two properties must hold

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:13.993
the first one is the additivity property

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:19.007
and the second one is the scaling property

00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:27.236
these two properties can be combined into a single statement known as the superposition property as given below

00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:31.417
in this video I have explained basic system properties

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:37.454
among these properties time invariance and linearity have great importance because

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:43.370
most of the systems encountered in nature can be modeled as linear and time invariant

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.921
in the next videos we are going to analyze continuous time and discrete time linear time invariant systems in more detail

00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:52.096
thank you
