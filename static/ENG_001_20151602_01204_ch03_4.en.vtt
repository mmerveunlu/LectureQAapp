hi everyone welcome to signals and systems course

00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:24.269
in this video I am going to explain fourier series representation of discrete time periodic signals

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:30.891
there are many similarities between continuous time and discrete time fourier series

00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:33.992
however there are also many differences

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:45.232
as you might remember fourier series representation of continuous time periodic signals consists of linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:47.858
the formulation is given here

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:53.678
note that it is an infinite series because we are summing up infinite number of terms

00:00:53.678 --> 00:01:00.004
however fourier series representation of discrete time periodic signals is a finite series

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:05.255
I am going to show how we obtain this representation in upcoming slides

00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:09.798
the infinite series representation leads to some converge issues

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:20.879
we have discussed the convergence issues of continuous time fourier series and when a signal can or can not be represented with fourier series in the previous lectures

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:27.122
since discrete time fourier series is a finite series there are no convergence issues

00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:33.179
the discrete time fourier series representation will also lead to periodic coefficients

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.460
note that the coefficients are not periodic in continuous time fourier series

00:01:39.248 --> 00:01:46.529
a discrete time signal is periodic with period n if if it satisfies the above equation

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:58.199
here fundamental period is the smallest positive integer n that satisfies the given equation and the fundamental frequency is computed as two pi over n

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:03.206
if there is a complex exponential which is periodic with period n

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:12.527
the set of all discrete time complex exponential signals periodic with period n is given below as phi sub k

00:02:12.527 --> 00:02:23.776
all of these signals have fundamental frequencies that are multiples of two pi over n and they are harmonically related complex exponentials

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:30.442
note that there are only n distinct signals in the given set

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:38.879
this is because of the fact that discrete time complex exponentials which differ by a factor of two pi are identical

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:47.645
using the same fact we can show that phi sub k and phi sub k plus n are identical signals

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:49.778
the proof is given below

00:02:51.994 --> 00:03:01.420
we can write down a general continuous time signal as the linear combination of harmonically related complex exponentials as given here

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:10.285
since there are only n distinct harmonically related signals we can write down the summation for n successive values of k

00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:20.260
this representation is referred to as discrete time fourier series and a sub k's are fourier series coefficients

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.644
note that this is a finite series composed of n terms and x of n is periodic with period n

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:35.435
so how can we compute the discrete time fourier series coefficients

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:43.122
fourier series coefficients are computed as given in the second equation which is called the synthesis equation

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:47.951
note that fourier series representation is called the analysis equation

00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:54.454
I want you to derive the synthesis equation from the analysis equation using the given hints below

00:03:56.505 --> 00:04:03.576
ok we know that we can compute the discrete time fourier series coefficients using the synthesis equation

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:15.746
here it is important to note that there are only n fourier series coefficients that need to be computed and the range for k can be any set of n consecutive integers

00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:23.021
as a result of that discrete time fourier series coefficients a sub k's are periodic with n

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:34.953
while discussing convergence issues of continuous time fourier series we observed that as we increase the number of terms in a finite summation

00:04:34.953 --> 00:04:39.312
fourier series representation converges to the original signal

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:44.200
however gibbs phenomenon occurs at the discontinuity points of the signal

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:56.436
any discrete time periodic signal is completely specified by a finite number of parameters so that there are no convergence issues and there is no gibbs phenomenon

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:02.730
let's move on to the properties of discrete time fourier series

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.319
this table summarizes the properties

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.918
the derivations of many of these properties are very similar to their continuous time counterparts

00:05:10.918 --> 00:05:18.534
here I will only explain some important properties that are different than their continuous time counterparts

00:05:20.647 --> 00:05:23.518
the first one is the multiplication property

00:05:23.518 --> 00:05:30.819
let's denote a sub k as fourier series coefficient of the discrete time periodic signal x of n

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:37.145
and b sub k as fourier series coefficient of the discrete time periodic signal y of n

00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:45.454
if we multiply these two signals fourier series coefficients of the multiplied signal is computed as given in the below equation

00:05:45.454 --> 00:05:55.792
we refer to this type of operation as periodic convolution where the summation can be taken over any set of n consecutive values

00:05:57.426 --> 00:06:05.095
first difference property is the discrete time parallel to the differentiation property of the continuous time fourier series

00:06:05.095 --> 00:06:12.089
if a sub k is fourier series coefficient of the discrete time periodic signal x of n

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:19.223
the fourier series coefficients corresponding to the first difference of x of n are computed as given below

00:06:19.223 --> 00:06:25.672
this equation can be obtained easily from time shifting and linearity properties

00:06:26.665 --> 00:06:31.109
the parseval relation for discrete time periodic signals is given here

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:38.488
note that the left hand side of this equation is the average power in one period for periodic signal x of n

00:06:38.488 --> 00:06:43.931
at the right hand side is the average power in all of its harmonic components

00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:55.146
as a result parseval's relation states that the average power in a periodic signal equals the sum of the average powers in all of its harmonic components

00:06:56.554 --> 00:07:05.691
in this video I have explained fourier series representation of discrete time periodic signals and the properties of discrete time fourier series

00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.970
let me know if you have any questions

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:08.925
thank you
