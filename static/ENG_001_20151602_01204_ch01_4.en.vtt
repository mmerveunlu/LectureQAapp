hi everyone welcome to signals and systems course

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:23.842
in this video I am going to explain unit impulse and unit step functions

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:28.455
these functions are very important in signal and system analysis

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:33.369
discrete time unit impulse is one of the simplest discrete time signals

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:36.571
unit impulse is also called unit sample

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:42.191
mathematical and graphical representations of the unit impulse function are given here

00:00:42.191 --> 00:00:48.889
unit impulse function is one at time equals zero and it is zero at anywhere else

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:56.781
note that unit impulse is a very important signal because it can be used to construct any discrete time signal

00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.909
another basic discrete time signal is discrete time unit step

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.610
mathematical and graphical representations of the unit step function are given here

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.275
unit impulse and unit step functions are closely related with each other

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:17.819
the relationship between these two functions is summarized here

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:24.578
for instance the discrete time unit impulse is the first difference of the discrete time unit step

00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:30.502
also the discrete time unit step is the running sum of discrete time unit sample

00:01:30.502 --> 00:01:35.875
we can write this equation in different forms by changing the variable of summation

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:42.227
the unit impulse sequence can also be used to sample the value of a signal at any time

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:50.078
continuous time unit step and unit impulse functions are defined in a similar way to their discrete time counterparts

00:01:50.078 --> 00:01:56.604
the unit step impulse can be thought of as the first derivative of the continuous time unit step

00:01:56.604 --> 00:02:03.523
the relationship between continuous time units step and unit impulse functions is summarized here

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:11.183
as I said before the unit step impulse can be thought of as the first derivative of the continuous time unit step

00:02:11.183 --> 00:02:16.479
the continuous time unit step is the running integral of the unit sample

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:22.782
additionally the unit impulse can be used to sample the value of a signal at any time

00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:30.164
in this video I have explained discrete time and continuous time unit impulse and unit step functions

00:02:30.164 --> 00:02:32.883
let me know if you have any questions
