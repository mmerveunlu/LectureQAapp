hi everyone welcome to signals and systems course

00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:23.478
in this video I am going to make an introduction to signals and systems

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:34.166
signals are defined as functions of one or more independent variables that typically carry some type of information

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.494
this figure shows a one dimensional signal

00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:44.128
here x axis is the time and y axis is the value of the function f of t

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:49.048
for instance the y axis can represent the temperature or speed

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:57.933
voltages and currents as a function of time in an electrical circuit are also examples of signals

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:06.804
for instance this plot shows the variation of the inductor current as a function of time which is a one dimensional signal

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.580
one very common example of a signal is a speech signal

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.667
you can think of the speech signal as the fluctuations in acoustic pressure as a function of time

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:23.830
a typical speech signal looks like as given in the figure

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.570
here the speech signal corresponds to the word hello

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:33.062
speech signal is also an example of one dimensional signals

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:38.721
another common example signal is the image signal

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:46.138
you can think of the image signal as the variations in brightness as a function of two spatial variables

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:51.364
therefore image signal is an example of two dimensional signals

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:54.888
this figure shows a binary felix cat image

00:01:54.888 --> 00:02:00.940
binary image means that the brightness values can be either one or zero

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:09.972
you can think of this image as a thirty five by thirty five matrix where each component of the matrix is one or zero

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.710
this figure also shows a popular gray scale image used in image processing

00:02:19.777 --> 00:02:29.002
the signals are categorized as continuous time signals and discrete time signals depending on the underlying independent variable

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.779
in case of continuous time signals

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:40.179
the independent variable is continuous and these signals are defined for a continuum of values of the independent variable

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:46.467
temperature and speed as a function of time are some examples of continuous time signals

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:54.281
however in discrete time signals independent variable takes on only a discrete set of values

00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:59.323
as a result these signals are defined only at discrete times

00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:06.162
stock market index as a function of weeks is and example of discrete time signal

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.989
to distinguish between continuous time and discrete time signals

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.020
we use different notations

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.568
the independent variable in continuous time signal is denoted by t and it is enclosed in parenthesis

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:32.134
on the other hand the independent variable in discrete time signal is denoted by n and it is enclosed in brackets

00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:37.271
these figures show continuous and discrete time signals graphically

00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:46.227
here it is important to note that discrete time signal is defined only for integer values of the independent variable

00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:52.385
a continuous time signal can be converted into a discrete time signal using sampling

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:56.469
you are going to learn more about these concepts throughout the course

00:04:00.064 --> 00:04:03.628
the next important topic in this course is the systems

00:04:03.628 --> 00:04:06.426
systems are used to process signals

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:13.315
for instance a camera is a system that receives light from different sources and produces a photograph

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:20.233
an electrical circuit by itself is a system where it responds to applied voltages and currents

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:27.785
also processing an image signal to produce its enhanced version is an example of a system

00:04:30.358 --> 00:04:34.963
systems are also categorized as continuous time and discrete time

00:04:34.963 --> 00:04:43.286
a continuous time system is a system where the input is a continuous time signal and this input results in an output

00:04:43.286 --> 00:04:45.526
which is also a continuous time signal

00:04:45.526 --> 00:04:50.758
the pictorial representation of such a system is given on the left hand side

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:58.555
a discrete time system transforms a discrete time input signal into a discrete time output signal

00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:03.986
the pictorial representation of a discrete time signal is given on the right hand side

00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:12.582
in this video I have made an introduction to signals and systems

00:05:12.582 --> 00:05:15.085
let me know if you have any questions

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:15.838
thank you
