00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:08.533
hi everyone welcome to signals and systems course

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:12.646
in this video I am going to explain the laplace transform

00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:16.838
as we all know from linear time invariant systems

00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:21.283
if the input to an lti system is a complex exponential

00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:26.484
the output of the system is the same complex exponential multiplied by a constant

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:31.921
the complex constant h of s is computed as given in the equation

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:37.856
in fourier analysis we only focus on purely imaginary values of s

00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:40.669
where s is equal to j omega

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:49.690
when s is equal to j omega the complex constant is obtained by taking the fourier transform of the impulse response

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.255
if s is chosen as a general complex number such as sigma plus j omega

00:00:56.255 --> 00:01:03.598
then we end up with the generalization of the continuous time fourier transform known as the laplace transform

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:10.569
the laplace transform of a general signal x of t is defined as given in the equation

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:14.611
where the laplace transform is denoted with x of s

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:25.284
if s is purely imaginary or s is equal to j omega we obtain the fourier transform of x of t with the same equation

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:35.317
here it is important to note that the fourier transform equation converges only when x of t is absolutely integrable

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.516
there is also a straightforward relationship between the laplace and fourier transforms even when s is not purely imaginary

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:53.529
if we rearrange the laplace transform equation by replacing s with sigma plus j omega

00:01:53.529 --> 00:02:01.818
the right side of the equation yields the fourier transform of the signal x of t times a real exponential signal

00:02:01.818 --> 00:02:12.573
note that this real exponential signal can be a decaying or growing exponential depending of whether sigma is positive or negative

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:22.641
since the laplace transform is interpreted as the fourier transform of x of t times a real exponential signal

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:27.139
we need to check the convergence of the given fourier transform expression

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:36.588
therefore the laplace transform of the given signal exists if the fourier transform expression given above converges

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:43.199
in other words if x of t times the real exponential signal is absolutely integrable

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:52.470
the values of the complex variable s for which the laplace transform converges is referred to as the region of convergence

00:02:54.295 --> 00:03:02.768
in the previous lectures we learned that fourier analysis is extremely important and useful in analyzing signals and systems

00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:11.135
however fourier transform can not handle large and important classes of signals and unstable systems

00:03:11.135 --> 00:03:22.581
for instance we can not analyze a signal using fourier transform if it is not absolutely integrable since the fourier transform does not converge

00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:29.873
the same is true for unstable systems because the impulse response is not absolutely integrable

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:36.030
laplace transform can be viewed as an extension of the fourier transform

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.377
laplace transform allows analysis of broader class of signals and systems including unstable systems

00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:47.318
now let's look at an example

00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:53.965
let x of t be the one sided real exponential signal given in the equation

00:03:53.965 --> 00:04:02.298
if a is greater than zero x of t is a decaying exponential signal and the fourier transform converges

00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:12.379
note that the fourier transform of x of t is obtained as one over j omega plus a when a is greater than zero

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:17.810
let's compute the laplace transform for the same decaying exponential signal

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:27.471
by using the laplace transform formula and by substituting s with sigma plus j omaga we obtain the highlighted expression

00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:33.895
note that this expression is the fourier transform of another real exponential signal

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.238
and this fourier transform converges only when the exponential signal is a decaying exponential

00:04:41.238 --> 00:04:48.554
in other words sigma plus a is greater than zero or sigma is greater than minus a

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:58.154
since s is equal to sigma plus j omega the laplace transform of the signal x of t is obtained as given in the below equation

00:04:58.154 --> 00:05:06.985
this laplace transform equation is valid only when sigma or the real part of s is greater than minus a

00:05:06.985 --> 00:05:13.161
note that this condition is referred to as region of convergence of x of s

00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:19.804
this figure shows region of convergence plot for the decaying exponential signal

00:05:19.804 --> 00:05:26.560
the horizontal axis is the real axis and the vertical axis is the imaginary axis in the s plane

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.199
the shaded area shows the region where the laplace transform integral converges

00:05:33.193 --> 00:05:39.224
here it is important to note that the j omega axis is inside the roc

00:05:39.224 --> 00:05:49.528
which means we can obtain the fourier transform of the signal x of t from its laplace transform by substituting s with j omega

00:05:49.528 --> 00:05:55.323
now let's perform the same analyses for the growing exponential signal x of t

00:05:55.323 --> 00:06:07.898
here the fourier transform does not converge since the growing exponential violates the absolute integrability condition required for the convergence of fourier transform

00:06:07.898 --> 00:06:13.324
in other words the fourier transform of that signal does not exist

00:06:14.609 --> 00:06:19.439
let's compute the laplace transform for the same growing exponential signal

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:26.508
again we obtain the highlighted equation by substituting s with sigma plus j omaga

00:06:26.508 --> 00:06:30.730
which is the fourier transform of another real exponential signal

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:37.754
this fourier transform converges only when the exponential signal is a decaying exponential

00:06:37.754 --> 00:06:44.783
in other words sigma plus a is greater than zero or sigma is greater than minus a

00:06:44.783 --> 00:06:56.194
the laplace transform expression for the growing exponential signal is given below which is valid only when the real part of s is greater than minus a

00:06:56.194 --> 00:07:03.050
note that we obtained the same expression with the laplace transform of the decaying exponential signal

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.907
however the region of convergences are different

00:07:08.316 --> 00:07:13.289
this figure shows region of convergence plot for the growing exponential signal

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:18.863
the shaded area shows the region where the laplace transform integral converges

00:07:18.863 --> 00:07:24.039
note that different than the roc of decaying exponential signal

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:29.946
the roc does not include the imaginary axis in other words j omega axis

00:07:29.946 --> 00:07:37.801
this is a very important observation since the fourier transform does not exist for the growing exponential signal

00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:49.071
therefore the roc does not include the j omega axis since the laplace transform integral is not valid when s is equal to j omega

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.627
now let's look at another example signal

00:07:52.627 --> 00:07:57.413
let x of t be the exponential signal given in the equation

00:07:57.413 --> 00:08:02.490
after taking the laplace transform we obtain the highlighted expression

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:12.980
note that this result is valid if the laplace transform integral converges in other words if the real part of s is less than minus a

00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:18.133
let's compare the two exponential signals that we have discussed in this video

00:08:18.133 --> 00:08:23.918
these two signals resulted in identical expressions as their laplace transforms

00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:27.624
however their region of convergences are different

00:08:27.624 --> 00:08:35.194
we can distinguish the time domain signals from identical laplace transform expressions using their rocs

00:08:35.194 --> 00:08:42.467
therefore specifying both the algebraic expression and the roc is important in the laplace transform

00:08:42.467 --> 00:08:50.791
assuming that a is greater than zero we can plot the rocs for these two laplace transforms as given in the figure

00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:54.595
let me summarize what we have discussed until now

00:08:54.595 --> 00:09:05.936
first fourier transform does not converge for all signals and the absolute integrability condition should hold for the existence of the fourier transform for a given signal

00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:12.736
second laplace transform may convergence for some values of s and not for others

00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:18.724
the values for which the laplace transform converges are referred to as the region of convergence

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:23.246
the region of convergence is determined by the real part of s

00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:27.930
third if j omega axis is inside the roc

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:36.449
the fourier transform exists and can be obtained directly from the laplace transform by substituting s with j omega

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:44.527
fourth if jey omega axis is not inside the roc the fourier transform does not exist for that signal

00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:58.276
fifth in specifying the laplace transform of a signal both the algebraic expression and the roc are required since laplace transforms of different signals may result in the same expression

00:09:58.832 --> 00:10:06.326
in this video I have explained the laplace transform integral and the region of convergence for the laplace transform

00:10:06.326 --> 00:10:08.976
let me know if you have any questions

00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:09.681
thank you
