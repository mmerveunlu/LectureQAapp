00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:18.375
hi everyone welcome to signals and systems course

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:27.983
in this video I am going to explain some important signal transformations that involve simple modifications of the independent variable

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:36.189
an important example of transforming the independent variable of a signal is a time shift

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:43.741
note that the independent variable is t in continuous time signals and n in discrete time signals

00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:48.227
this figure shows a discrete time signal and its shifted version

00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:54.509
here two signals are identical in shape but shifted relative to each other

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:57.405
if n zero is greater than zero

00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:04.264
the signal shifts to the right and the shifted signal is said to be the delayed version of the original signal

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.735
if n zero is less than zero

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:14.082
the signal shifts to the left and the shifted signal is said to be the advanced version of the original signal

00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:20.580
the same principles apply while shifting a continuous time signal

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.781
in the figure a continuous time signal and its shifted version are shown

00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:32.594
a second basic transformation of the time axis is the time reversal

00:01:32.594 --> 00:01:39.186
the reversed signal is obtained from the original signal by a reflection around n equals zero

00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:43.356
time reversal on a discrete time signal is shown in the figure

00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:54.714
for a continuous time signal the reversed signal is obtained from the original signal by a reflection around t equals zero

00:01:54.714 --> 00:02:01.557
the figure shows the original signal x of t and its reflection around t equals zero

00:02:01.557 --> 00:02:10.050
if x of t represents audio tape recording then its reflection is the same tape recording played backward

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:15.523
another transformation is the time scale

00:02:15.523 --> 00:02:22.097
this figure shows three signals that are related by linear scale change in the independent variable

00:02:22.097 --> 00:02:32.516
if we think of x of t as a tape recording then x of two t is the same recording played twice speed of the original recording

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:40.607
and x  of t over two is also the same recording played at half speed of the original recording

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:51.159
assume that x of t is the original signal and it is transformed to another signal as x of alpha t plus beta

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:58.084
depending on the values of alpha and beta the original signal goes through several transformations

00:02:58.084 --> 00:03:03.951
for instance the signal is stretched if the absolute value of alpha is less than one

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:07.414
if it is larger than one the signal is compressed

00:03:07.414 --> 00:03:10.879
the signal is reversed in time if alpha is negative

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.544
and it is shifted in time if beta is not equal to zero

00:03:15.544 --> 00:03:18.036
if there is more than one transformation

00:03:18.036 --> 00:03:28.256
the systematic approach is to delay or advance the signal in accordance with the value of beta first and than do the time scaling and reversal

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:39.825
the plot on the right hand side shows the original signal x of t and the plots on the left hand side show various transformations

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.101
the first transformation is the time shift where the original signal is advanced by one unit

00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.587
in other words it is shifted to left

00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:56.757
the second one is the time reversed version of x of t plus one

00:03:58.642 --> 00:04:02.768
the third one is the time scaled version of the original signal

00:04:02.768 --> 00:04:07.488
here the original signal is compressed by a factor of two over three

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:15.321
and the last one is the time scaled version of of x of t plus one

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.076
an important class of signals that we are going to use in this course is the periodic signals

00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:28.386
periodic continuous time and discrete time signals hold the given property

00:04:28.386 --> 00:04:36.575
in words a periodic signal has the property that it is unchanged by a time shift of t for continuous time signals

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:40.620
and by a time shift of n for discrete time signals

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:48.077
fundamental period is the smallest positive value of t or n for which the given equality holds

00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:52.725
here examples of continuous and discrete time signals are given

00:04:52.725 --> 00:05:01.111
fundamental period of the continuous time signal is t and fundamental period of the discrete time signal is three

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:09.612
the property of being even or odd relates to the symmetry of signals under time reversal

00:05:09.612 --> 00:05:16.611
a signal is referred to as an even signal if it is identical to its time reversed counterpart

00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:23.679
a signal is referred to as an odd signal if it holds the given equality on the right hand side

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:29.463
an odd signal must necessarily be zero at t or n equals zero

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:33.426
examples of even and odd signals are given here

00:05:35.087 --> 00:05:45.186
in this video I first explained some important transformations of the independent variable such as time shift time reversal and time scaling

00:05:45.186 --> 00:05:50.292
these transformations will be useful in analyzing the properties of systems

00:05:50.292 --> 00:05:57.285
I also explained some important class of signals such as periodic signals and even and odd signals

00:05:57.285 --> 00:05:59.692
let me know if you have any question

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:00.480
thank you
