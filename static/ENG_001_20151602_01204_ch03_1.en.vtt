hi everyone welcome to signals and systems course

00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:25.157
in this video I am going to explain the response of linear time invariant systems to complex exponentials

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:34.604
assume that we have a linear time invariant system where the input is x of n and the output is y of n

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:39.777
using the linearity property if the input is the sum of scaled signals

00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:44.700
the output will be the sum of scaled responses of these input signals

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:57.579
as you might remember analysis of linear time invariant systems through convolution was developed by decomposing the input signal into the summation of basic signals which were shifted impulses

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.070
the output to each shifted impulse was the shifted impulse response of the system

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:13.192
currently we explore alternative representation of signals and linear time invariant systems using another set of basic signals

00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:15.147
which are complex exponentials

00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:22.348
in fourier analysis we are going to represent signals as linear combination of complex exponentials

00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:27.205
so why do we choose complex exponentials

00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:32.696
the answer is that as the basic signals they satisfy the given two properties

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:37.256
the first one is that their system response is straightforward to compute

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:43.083
the second one is that they can be used to construct a broad range of signals

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:52.390
so let's apply a complex exponential as input to a linear time invariant system and compute its output

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:02.290
when a complex exponential is applied as input the output of the system is the same complex exponential multiplied by a complex constant

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.865
note that this is true both for the discrete and continuous time signals

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:11.530
its derivation is quite straightforward using the convolution operation

00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:22.034
a signal for which the system output is a constant times input is referred to as an eigen function of the system

00:02:22.034 --> 00:02:26.563
and the amplitude is referred to as the system's eigen value

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:35.396
this is a very important property stating that complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of linear time invariant systems

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:40.883
eigenvalues h of s and h of z are computed as given here

00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:52.333
the eigen function property together with the superposition property leads to convenient expression for the response of a linear time invariant system

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:58.011
if the input to a linear time invariant system is a linear combination of complex exponentials

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:07.244
then the output is also represented as the linear complication combin  sorry linear combination of same complex exponential signals

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:16.357
in this video I have explained response of linear time invariant systems to complex exponentials

00:03:16.357 --> 00:03:23.550
in the next video I am going to explain fourier series representation of continuous time periodic signals

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.418
thank you
